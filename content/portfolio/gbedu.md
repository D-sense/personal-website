[Gbedu - Music Streaming Platform](https://gbedu.live). January 2019 - March 2019:

As a Software Engineer:
- Built on an open-source audio-bpm extraction package to help improve the customer’s music recommendation experience.

- Built on audio and image transcoding engine to enable us to process asset transcoding and conversion with ease; this decreases the loading time of our web application assets (audio tracks and album/tracks images), thus improving customer’s experience.

- Migrated existing audio tracks/images and provided support for future uploaded tracks/files to DigitalOcean by extending the existing package; this helped the company to cut some costs monthlyxtended the authentication service to allow users on a partner’s platform to authenticate on our platform without the need to sign-up on our platform (SSO). This improved the user experience of new customers and increased the number of our customers.
