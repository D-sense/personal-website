[Tremendoc - Tele-health Platform](https://tremendoc.com). December 2017- January 2019:

As a Fullstack Developer:
- Integrated third-party SDK to enable an audio and video medical consultation; this feature tripled the number of customers as they prefer more a more engaging medical consultation rather than just a textual communication.

- Extended the authentication service to allow users on a partnerâ€™s platform to authenticate on our platform without the need to sign-up on our platform (SSO). This improved the user experience of new customers and increased the number of our customers.
