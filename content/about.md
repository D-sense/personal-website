Hi, I am Adesina Hammed Hassan. I work at The Linux Foundation as Software Engineer.

I enjoy technical writing and speaking about Go/Golang; (I am the organizer of Go/Golang meetups in Nigeria).

In my professional journey, I have honed my skills in designing and building robust software applications, employing both microservice and monolithic architectures. 
I take pride in my ability to create modular and resilient solutions. 
Furthermore, it has always been a cherished aspiration of mine to achieve the status of a Google Developer Expert in Go.

I enjoy building solutions. Currently, I’m co-founding [GetTreasure (PolicyGenius for Africa)](https://gettreasure.com).
