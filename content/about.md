Hi, I am Adesina Hammed Hassan. I'm a Senior Software Engineer (Go/Golang) with 7+ years of experience delivering scalable, high-performance cloud-native systems for fintech, e-commerce, and open-source platforms. Currently based in Birmingham & London, England, I work at The Linux Foundation in California, where I design and develop core tooling that powers LFX services and supports thousands of users.

Throughout my professional journey, I have led backend teams, optimized system performance achieving measurable business outcomes like reducing search latency by 40% and improving system reliability to 99.9% uptime. I'm passionate about distributed system design, cloud infrastructure, and translating technology into business value.

Beyond my day job, I'm deeply involved in the Go community as the organizer of Lagos Gophers Community, which I've grown to become the largest Go community in Africa with over 2000+ members. I enjoy technical writing, speaking about Go/Golang, and mentoring engineers to help them grow in their careers.

I take pride in building robust, modular solutions that solve real-world problems, whether it's processing 200M+ product feeds for major e-commerce affiliates or developing tools that increase user engagement by 20%.
